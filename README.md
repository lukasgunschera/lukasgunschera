### Hi, I am Lukas 👋

- 👨‍🎓 I am a PhD candidate in Social Policy at the University of Oxford.

- 👨‍🔬 My research examines the relationship between social media use and mental health, and how this relationship depends on individual differences in cognition. I examine this question both cross-sectionally and longitudinally using computational approaches.

- 🔑 Transparency and reproducibility are core values guiding my research. I aim to make my code accessible to the public.

- 💻 You can find more info on my work on my website: https://lukasgunschera.com/.
